# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation for building this Prework Study Guide Webpage was to solidify my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git/GitHub.
- I built this webpage to organize my prework knowledge.  Having a single location where I can organize my notes on what I've learned in the prework phase proves useful in reinforcing the concepts I've learned.
- I was able to encounter and solve problems and have first hand experience in building and styling a webpage from scratch.
- I've learned skills like HTML basics, CSS styling, JavaScript functions, and Git workflows. I learned how to use version control, like staging, committing, pushing, and pulling changes. I've also become familiar with development tools such as code editors, browser developer tools, and command-line interfaces.
